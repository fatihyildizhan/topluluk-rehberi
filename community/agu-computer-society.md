# AGU Computer Society

AGU Computer Society is a meritocratic, consensus-based community.  Anyone with an interest in a project related to computer science can  join the community, contribute to a project design and participate  in the decision-making process. It started its life as an independent  society in 2017 but now it is a student club at Abdullah GÃ¼l University. We have organized many workshops, hackathons and conferences so far.  Check our social media accounts to follow future events.
